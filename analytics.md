## Overview

The **Analytics** module displays key metrics of your bots, at real-time so you can track the efficiency and performance of your bots and interactions with the users. Understanding the metrics is key to keep improving your bots.

* **Responses:** Total responses received by channel, action item, date and time
* **Top Intents:** What conversations do your customers have with the bot
* **Live Agent:** No of conversations that included humans, by channel, date and time
* **QnA:** Know what questions your users asked the bot
