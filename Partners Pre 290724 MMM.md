| Project T3    | DI, TP, HN, CP, DN, LP | VN        | K12 schools        | USD 93m for 100% stake | the rest of DT? - Privatization of public schools - more context around this, has this happened across the country, how many, how is it done, public perception, risk of corruption, etc - Large amount of land for expansion (c. 15 schools), while utilization is very low. Is it necessary / needed? - Lots of questions raised that needs to be analysed, answered to get conviction - impact of land on valuation and economics, does the business require so much land for future expansion, thorough profitability, capacity, utilization, revenue, operating cost and returns analysis vs IGC/BMS - Either a lower growth opportunity (which translates to a lower multiple) or requires more costs factored in to accelerate growth. - Deal can be self funded from debt financing - Diligence on ESG and fire safety DD needed, capex to be factored as debt like. - CDD to understand in detail the demand / purchasing power in each of the schools' catchment | - Proceed to submit NBIO (option which is just over US$50mn in Equity value).
